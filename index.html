			<h3>Major</h3>

				<p>I am a technical commmunication major, with a minor in Visual Communication Design. I have a focus on editing and layout design. Technical communication is one of the most broad majors offered at Eastern Washington University, and is the only bachelor&#39;s program available in Washington State. It focuses on editing, design, publications, among other things.</p>

				<p>Ideally, I would like to use this major to work for a game company, editing game dialogue scripts or working on character development. If I were able to get a position with Valve Corporation, I think I would probably have a heart attack. Bethesda Softworks also holds a special place in my heart for their work on the Fallout series, which is by far my favorite game.</p>

			<h3>Background Info</h3>

				<p>I am originally from the desert oasis of Kennewick, WA, but now live in Cheney, WA while attending Eastern Washington University. I have some experience working in both technical and editorial fields, as well as a passion for casual gaming, which I feel will eventually help me to reach my lofty goal.</p>

				<p>I enjoy creative writing and illustrating my own work. I have attempted -- and failed -- <a href="*" id="bodylink">NaNoWriMo</a> multiple times, especially since there is a particular story that is just itching to get out. I just can&#39;t seem to find time or the eloquence to get the narrative out. Another hobby of mine is also gaming, particularly playing the Fallout series. My favorite kinds of games are the RPG -role-playing game - type like Pok√©mon and Fallout. I also like strategic games like Prison Architect and Fire Emblem.</p>
